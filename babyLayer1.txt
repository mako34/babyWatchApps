I found this on my phone today. It transmits every details of your phone and it can remotely access all your documents.

This is a serious accusation, the OP should include concrete evidence and more details.

Here is my research:

Adups is a Chinese provider of FOTA (firmware over-the-air) update services to a number of OEMs including Elephone. In 2016, there was this news about spyware in some of BLU devices. Here is a good read: https://android.gadgethacks.com/news...yware-0175014/

Here are official Adups' responses: http://www.adups.com/article/article.php?id=113
transmitting text, data, call, location, and app data to a Chinese server every 72 hours

Sounds to me like that thing happened to some BLU devices and then Adups updated the OTA app to remove that thing. And, I checked our OTA app is newer than that of the BLU in the news.

Anyway, for those who want to check or remove the app in question, below is how.
If you don't know how to use ADB, then you should probably just skip the rest of my comment. 
The following commands don't require root to work.


To check:

>adb shell
>pm list packages -f|grep adups

package:/system/app/FastBoardFactory/FastBoardFactory.apk=com.sgtc.fastboardfactory

package:/system/app/AdupsFotaReboot/AdupsFotaReboot.apk=com.adups.fota.sysoper

Reconozco en reloj

if remove,,, For one thing, obviously you will not get Firmware update via OTA.

>pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.adups.fota
>pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.adups.fota.sysoper

 according to kryptowire, and despite adups' claims to the contrary, 
 adups spyware problems continued in 2017. 
 These include enabling adups to run any software they like on your phone at any time. 
 Not only that, but the backdoor uses unsecured comms protocols that could potentially be exploited by ... well, anyone.
